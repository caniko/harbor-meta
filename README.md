# harbor-meta

Shared harbor helpers for editor and agent tooling.

`harbor-meta` owns cross-language policy shared by the language harbors.

Formatting uses independent [treefmt modules](docs/treefmt.md), composed
explicitly by each repository rather than inherited from a parent Harbor.

Dev shells are fragments `{ packages, env, shellHook }`. Language harbors merge
those fragments and render them with `lib.devShell.mkShell` (`pkgs.mkShell` by
default; Rust passes a `craneLib.devShell` builder). `lib.devShellTests` and
`lib.templateTests` evaluate harbor templates by importing their `flake.nix`
with the current flake inputs — no nested `nix` and no template lockfiles.

`lib.flake.mkDerivationManifest` records exact derivation paths and selected
outputs without retaining string context. Orchestrators can serialize that
manifest and realize the same derivations locally or on an explicitly selected
remote builder without changing store identity.

Opencode LSP discovery remains a separate surface: checked-in
`.opencode/opencode.jsonc` files declare the LSPs opencode may use, while each
project's direnv-powered harbor dev shell supplies the actual binaries.

OpenPencil MCP is opt-in. Default generated configs stay LSP-only. Pass
`--openpencil` to register the server. The desktop binary must already be on
PATH. OpenCode code mode (`OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_CODE_MODE`) defers MCP
schemas behind the `execute` tool.

## Agent shells and validation

For projects using `.envrc` with `use flake .`, agent subprocesses do not
necessarily load direnv automatically. Run `direnv exec . <command>` from the
project root for each invocation; loading one subprocess does not change its
parent's PATH. If `.envrc` is blocked, stop for review and explicit authorization
before `direnv allow .`. Never silently authorize a project's shell hooks.

Use `lib.devShellTests.mkCheck` with an explicit `commands` list to check that
tools are available from the shell's native build inputs without the user's
host PATH. Build the resulting check: `nix flake check --no-build` only evaluates
it. This is an executable-availability check, not a runtime or direnv activation
test. Keep application startup and dependency-import checks separate.

## Usage

```bash
harbor-opencode sync --kind detect
harbor-opencode sync --kind rust --openpencil
harbor-opencode check --kind detect
harbor-opencode rollout --root /data/nvme0/can/Projects
```
